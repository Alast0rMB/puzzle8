In this project AI search algorithms are used to find solotuions for the 8 puzzle. This project gives the user multiple options to choose which type of search algorithm they want to use. Also the users can either chose the initial state of the puzzle themselves or use a randomizer to create it.
Needs Tkinter packages to run.

ps: This is my first time using python and Tkinter. This project is both a homework for my AI class and a way for me to learn python.
